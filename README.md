# games-dictionary-second-program-i-made-
i made this the second week of December 2025 and it started as a very simple "games list = [x,y,z]" and i was going to index to find the games, instead i became bored immediately and thought of how to fill it out, so it became more complex and i added persistent storage to it because i want to open it and see what games i saved
